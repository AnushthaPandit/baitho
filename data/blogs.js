    content: `How Vedanta Limited's ‘Project Clean Energy’ is driving improved socio-economic outcomes in rural Odisha

Among rural communities in Odisha, access to clean cooking fuels can be a challenge. Traditionally, families have relied on firewood for meeting their needs, which results in indoor pollution and lingering health issues, especially for women. We are helping address this gap by providing smokeless chullahs and clean lighting solutions.

Lanjigarh is a town located within the Kalahandi district of Odisha. It is home to our state-of-the-art alumina refinery, which feeds Vedanta Aluminium’s smelters in Jharsuguda, Odisha and Korba, Chhattisgarh. Given its remote location, the region has had limited access to opportunities for socio-economic development. However, it is now undergoing a radical transformation through focused interventions. Project Clean Energy is one such initiative, illustrating our consistent efforts to bring enhanced quality of life and well-being to its people.

Vedanta Limited, Lanjigarh, as part of Project Clean Energy, has implemented two important programs, aimed at enhancing the socio-economic conditions of the local community. With a thrust on providing cleaner cooking and lighting technologies, these initiatives have brought about significant changes in the lives of the residents, particularly in the form of enhanced respiratory health, reduced carbon emissions, and improved energy access.

One of the key objectives of the Clean Cooking program is to enhance the respiratory health of women by promoting fuel-efficient cooking stoves, commonly known as ‘chullahs’. Under the initiative, Vedanta Limited has supported over 226 families in Lanjigarh by eliminating the use of traditional chullahs, which often lead to indoor air pollution. By promoting fuel-efficient chullahs, Vedanta has successfully reduced carbon emissions and wood consumption by more than 50% per household.

Additionally, Vedanta has also implemented the Clean Lighting initiative, which has provided support to 850 households in Lanjigarh. This program aims to improve energy access and reduce reliance on traditional sources of lighting. By promoting solar-based lanterns, Vedanta has brought about a positive change in the lives of community members, ensuring they have access to clean and reliable lighting solutions for their work and studies.

One of the beneficiaries of Vedanta's Clean Energy initiatives is Padma Majhi from Belamba village in Lanjigarh. She shared her experience, saying “Vedanta has supported us with Fuel Efficient Chullahs and also demonstrated how to use it properly. The chullah has minimised smoke emissions and the amount of wood consumed in our house has also come down due to this initiative. The reduced smoke also prevents eye irritations, nor does one face difficulty in breathing while cooking. I have been using the chullah since the last 3 months and I express my gratitude towards Vedanta for this initiative”.

Padma Majhi's experience underscores the positive impact of these initiatives on the lives of individuals and families. Vedanta Limited's Clean Energy initiative in Lanjigarh has proven to be a significant success in enabling community members to experience a better quality of life.`,

    content: `India as a country rich in its demographic dividend could play a critical role in achieving the nation’s ambitious target to become a USD 5 trillion economy. At Vedanta, we continue to empower communities and transform lives through sustainable and inclusive growth with an unwavering commitment to empowering youth through skill development. One of our endeavours has been the transformation of the Sesa Technical School, an initiative since 1994 aimed to equip local youth in Goa with relevant skills to successfully enter the workforce or embark on their entrepreneurial journeys. Till date, STS has transformed the lives of over 1,700 individuals, enabling them to lead dignified lives through meaningful employment.

This is the story of a boy from a small village called Virdi, located near the Sesa Goa mines. He came from a humble background and always dreamed of pursuing higher education. However, due to financial constraints, his family was unable to support his aspirations. Undeterred by the circumstances, Pratap was determined to find a way to pursue his passion for learning. After completing his schooling, he discovered a glimmer of hope - to enrol in the Machinist trade at Sesa Technical School. This renowned institution, under the aegis of Sesa Goa, offered industrial training at a nominal fee. Pratap saw this as his opportunity to gain knowledge and skills in the field he desired.

Upon enrolling in STS, Pratap quickly realized that he had made the right decision. The faculty at the school were exceptional, providing both theoretical and practical education that surpassed his expectations. During his two years at STS, Pratap delved deep into the concepts of his chosen field and honed his skills under the guidance of experienced instructors. True to its reputation, STS opened doors for Pratap and secured him a placement at German Remedies, where he worked diligently as an operator for a year, gaining valuable industry experience. Pratap's dedication caught the attention of a renowned FMCG company, where he worked for a short while before a life-changing opportunity presented itself.

In 2001, Pratap received an offer to work with a prominent Japanese company based in Gurgaon. Accepting the opportunity, he embarked on a journey that would shape his future. Over the next eight years, Pratap dedicated himself to his work, excelling in his role and earning recognition for his contributions. His company recognized his potential and sponsored his Diploma course in Mechanical Engineering, allowing him to further enhance his knowledge and expertise. With his newfound qualifications and experience, Pratap sought fresh challenges. He joined a prominent multinational as a Utility Engineer before moving on to roles such as Project Engineer and Quality Manager. His commitment to his craft and solid understanding of his field garnered attention, as well as his dedication to maintaining high standards and ensuring excellence in all aspects of the company's operations earned him admiration from his peers. In 2011, Pratap embarked on a new chapter of his career, joining Electro chemical giant, where he earned the position of Production In charge and Safety Manager.

Reflecting on his journey, Pratap expresses his gratitude to Vedanta. From an operator to a manager, his unwavering determination and the solid foundation laid by Vedanta’s skilling initiatives have propelled him to great heights. As he stands at the pinnacle of his career, he cherishes the memories of his early struggles and the opportunities that shaped his life. His story has become an inspiration to many aspiring individuals, reminding them that with education, perseverance, and training, they too can overcome any obstacle and turn their dreams into reality.`,

    content: `Vedanta Limited, an industry leader in digital transformation, is constantly pushing the envelope in people’s practices. Unveiling the latest in a series of pioneering initiatives, we have rolled out a groundbreaking simulation-based experimental learning program that seeks to equip our next-gen leaders with the skills and competencies needed to ascend to future CXO roles. Our goal has always been clear – fostering growth from within and creating high-performing, dynamic leaders who are ready to navigate the ever-evolving business landscape.

Keeping this in mind, we have curated a learning module specifically for our mid-level managers – bright minds who are on the cusp of becoming future CXOs. These individuals are primed to lead strategic business units (SBUs). To ensure that they are future-ready and equipped to tackle emerging challenges, we realized the need for a unique training module, one that transcends the boundaries of traditional learning and development.

Our solution to this is a bespoke training module that encapsulates a simulation-based learning program. This experimental approach allows our mid-managers to immerse themselves in realistic business scenarios, enabling them to learn and adapt in a simulated environment before facing the challenges of the real business world. The gamified context not only enhances the learning experience but also fosters a sense of ownership and personal investment in their development journey. The participants in this program are identified through our various talent management initiatives such as Management ACT UP, Emerging Leaders, V-Lead, VC Growth Workshops, and nominations by department heads and HR. The program consists of eight sessions, each honing a specific competency: 1) Behavioral Critical Thinking; 2) Business Acumen; 3) Stakeholder Management; 4) Team Handling; 5) Digital Leadership; 6) Innovation; 7) Agile Working; and, 8) Design Thinking.

We focus on experiential learning, combining in-classroom teachings, case discussions, business simulations, and assessments. It not only fosters a deeper understanding of the intricacies of leadership but also allows for practical application and immediate feedback through our leaderboard system and pre & post-program assessment scores. The multi-faceted approach ensures our emerging leaders are well-rounded, capable of strategic decision-making, and proficient in modern digital operations. This training module aligns seamlessly with our vision of 'Leadership from within', enhancing our talent pipeline to take up strategic projects overseen by our senior leadership. We foresee these trained leaders driving organizational growth, fostering a learning culture that encourages knowledge-sharing, innovative idea generation, and collaborations at all levels.

This learning module is a vital piece in our high-level strategic blueprint, an extension of our commitment to embedding innovative people practices across the organization. It empowers individuals to grow both professionally and personally, equipping them with future-ready skills. They are better prepared to deliver on business outcomes, improve process efficiency, and navigate the digital landscape. Simultaneously, it strengthens our organization, turning it into a robust, agile entity ready to meet the future head-on.

We are proud to be spearheading digital change in people practices with innovative initiatives like this leadership training module. By investing in the development of a world-class workforce, we are strengthening our commitment to ensuring our continued success. Today, we stand on the cusp of a new era in learning and development, ready to lead the charge into the future.`,

    content: `India is a powerhouse when it comes to the available workforce, as 50% of the country's population is below the age of 25. Though blessed with this natural resource, not every youth entering the workforce is employable. The students need 21st-century skills along with formal education to secure employment opportunities and earn a livelihood.

India's demographic dividend is an advantage that can transform India into a global skills hub. The skill gap has been considered by the National Education Policy (NEP) released in 2020 which recommends training students in vocational skills right from Class 6. It envisions a process where students are trained in job-ready skills, go through internships, and gain employment in the future. The youth of India is facing a roadblock both in achieving the degrees on paper that they want and the vocational skills that they need. Thus, there is a need to ensure that India's youth is supported in completing higher education and gaining the right skills to secure employment.

Vedanta Foundation runs under the aegis of the Anil Agarwal Foundation and has been empowering the less privileged since 1992. Established in line with the founding family's mission of giving back to society, Vedanta Foundation has constantly contributed to the making of a new India where access to education and livelihood is not a privilege, through its program Vedanta Shiksha and Vedanta Rojgar. Through Vedanta Rojgar, the Foundation aims to transform lives through employment-linked skill training in the community. It provides skill training through over 84 vocational training centers across India to equip youth with the necessary skills to become self-reliant. The skilling centers run computer literacy, financial literacy, and digital literacy courses aiding the youth to gain meaningful employment in the organized sector and increase their earning potential. To bridge the academic industry gap, course modules are designed as per the requirement of the industries. Vedanta Rojgar helps reduce poverty and create a more inclusive society by providing equal opportunities for all sections of society. Since its inception, the foundation has trained over 1.4 million youth across the Nation.`,
